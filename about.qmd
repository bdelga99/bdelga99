I grew up in Chapel Hill, NC. I studied economics and mathematics at Williams College. After that, I worked as a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for two years, supporting Simon Fuchs and Veronika Penciakova with their work on spatial economics and firm dynamics, respectively. Currently, I am a first-year PhD student at Brown University, looking to work on issues related to health, education, and labor economics.
